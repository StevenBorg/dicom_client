# DICOM_client
> DICOM_client is a Python client for accessing a DICOMweb API endpoint. Although it can be used as a client API, it's better to think of this project as a way to learn how to use DICOMweb than leverage as a package for building a professional system. 


## Install

`pip install dicom_client`

## How to use

The best way to use this project is to open the notebooks where the code is defined. It uses the nbdev tool from fastai to generate a PyPl resource, plus all the documentation.  

```python
1+1
```
